Welcome to G: your daily plan for Tuesday 17 February

Good morning, Jon Searle

Today is light on scheduled events, so it’s a good day to prepare for tomorrow’s interview.

Main things to get done today
1. Prepare for interview tomorrow (Review key points and questions for the Principal Product Manager interview scheduled for 10 AM UTC on February 18th.)

Prioritize first
Use today to get comfortable with the interview topics and rest well tonight.
